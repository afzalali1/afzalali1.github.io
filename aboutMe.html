<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="images/aboutMe.jpg" alt="Afzal Ali">
<p>I am currently in my final year studying Computer Science at De Montfort University. With both my education and work experience I have gained a vast amount of knowledge and experience over the years. This includes extensive knowledge of software development as well as proficiency in several programming languages.<br>
<br>This has been very beneficial as it allowed me to put into practice things I have learnt into my working life. An example of this was the project management method PRINCE2. I was able to use the model to divide projects into manageable and controllable stages.</p>
